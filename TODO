Responsiveness

Linter, prettier ie only single quotes
is it possible to avoid direction = { "center"} in jsx ? use direction = 'center'
Reorder imports ie { Container, Box, Typography, Link, Accordion } to {  Accordion,  Box, Container, Link,  Typography }

Add .componentXXXX to scss files ie headerContainer instead of container
Split into more components if needed

Add azul feld to design system

Replace px with correct values

Remove unused css classes

Add design system values

Should I remove all the sx created for responsiveness and use something better?
